                        It does a shallow search for the username. Replace the

  --specify {0,1,2,3,4,5} [{0,1,2,3,4,5} ...]
                        Use the index number to return a specific part of the
                        page. about: 0, about_contact_and_basic_info: 1,
                        about_family_and_relationships: 2, about_details: 3,

                        account, however you have the search user in your
                        friends list.
  --password PASSWORD   Set the password for your facebook account, this
                        parameter has to be used with --email.

output:
  -o, --file-output     Save the output data to a .txt file.
  -c, --compact         Compress all .txt files. Use together with -o.
```

To search for a user:

* User name: `python3 fisherman.py -u name name.profile name.profile2`
* ID: `python3 fisherman.py -i 000000000000`

The username must be found on the facebook profile link, such as:

```
https://facebook.com/name.profile/
```

It is also possible to load multiple usernames from a .txt file, this can be useful for a brute force output type:

```
python3 fisherman.py --use-txt filename.txt
```

Some profiles are limited to displaying your information for any account, so you can use your account to extract. Note:
this should be used as the last hypothesis, and the target profile must be on your friends list:

```
python3 fisherman.py --email youremail@email.com --password yourpass
```

### Some situations:

* For complete massive scrape:
  ```
  python3 fisherman.py --use-txt file -o -c -sf
  ```
  With a file with dozens of names on each line, you can make a complete "scan" taking your information and even your
  family members and will be compressed into a .zip at the output.


* For specific parts of the account:
    * Basic data: `python3 fisherman.py -u name --specify 0`
    * Family and relationship: `python3 -u name --specify 2`
    * It is still possible to mix: `python3 fisherman.py -u name --specify 0 2`


* To get additional things like profile picture, how many followers and how many friends:
  ```
  python3 fisherman.py -u name [-s | --several]
  ```
  
* For a short search by people's name:
  ```
  python3 fisherman.py [-S | --search] foo
  ```
  Replace the spaces in the name with "."(periods).
  The script returns around 30 profiles.

* To filter the search:
  ```
  python3 fisherman.py -S name -work fisherman
  ```
  If the filter has spaces, enclose it in quotes.
  
* For a minimalist execution:
  ```
  python3 fisherman.py [-q | --quiet]
  ```
  Considerably reduces the script's output texts and, by convention, improves performance.

## Contributing
I would love to have your help in developing this project.

Some things you can help me with:
  * Add more search filters.

Please look at the Wiki entry on [Adding filters to the search argument](https://github.com/Godofcoffe/FisherMan/wiki/Adding-filters-to-the-search-argument) to understand the issues.
